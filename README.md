# Telecom’s AI-Powered War on Spam & Fraud

### Part of the *Weekend Renaissance* Series by me

Telecom networks form the nervous system of modern connectivity and spam, scams, and fraud are its chronic diseases.  
This project explores how **AI and machine learning** can serve as an *intelligent immune system* for telecoms — detecting, learning, and defending against evolving threats in real-time.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Detect fraudulent call/SMS patterns using AI/ML  
- Implement anomaly detection models for real-time traffic monitoring  
- Explore NLP for spam classification and intent recognition  
- Build explainable AI dashboards for security teams  

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow/PyTorch**  
- **Elasticsearch / Kafka (optional)** for stream data  
- **Flask / FastAPI** for visualization and API integration  
- **Jupyter / Streamlit** for interactive analysis
